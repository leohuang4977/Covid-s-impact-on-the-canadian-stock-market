# Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian Stock Market

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian stock market, specifically focusing on the S&P/TSX Composite Index. By examining COVID-19 case data alongside stock market performance, we seek to identify correlations and trends that illustrate how the pandemic influenced market dynamics in Canada.

## Data Sources
COVID-19 Data: Sourced from Our World in Data, this dataset includes daily records of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates globally, with specific data for Canada.
S&P/TSX Composite Index Data: Obtained from Yahoo! Finance, this dataset provides daily closing prices and other relevant metrics for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.

## Methodology
Data Preparation
Importing Data: Load the COVID-19 and stock market datasets into a SQL database for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Ensure all datasets are free from inconsistencies, missing values, and errors to maintain analysis accuracy.

## Analysis
COVID-19 Metrics:

Calculate daily and cumulative cases, deaths, and vaccination rates in Canada.
Determine infection and death rates as percentages of the population.
Stock Market Metrics:

Analyze daily closing prices of the S&P/TSX Composite Index.
Compute daily returns and volatility measures to assess market fluctuations.
Correlation Analysis:

Examine the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and stock market performance.
Identify periods where significant changes in COVID-19 data correspond with notable market movements.
## Visualization
Utilize [Tableau] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leo.huang2803/viz/TSXpriceandcovid/Dashboard1?publish=yes) to create interactive dashboards that display:

* Trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates over time.
* S&P/TSX Composite Index performance during the same periods.
* Correlations between pandemic developments and stock market responses.

## Key Findings
Market Decline and Recovery: The S&P/TSX Composite Index experienced a significant decline of approximately 37% between February 19 and March 23, 2020, due to the economic impact of COVID-19. By the end of August 2020, the index had recovered most of its losses, exhibiting a V-shaped recovery pattern.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates a strong correlation between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased volatility in the Canadian stock market. While the market demonstrated resilience with a V-shaped recovery, the initial impact was profound, underscoring the sensitivity of financial markets to global health crises.

## Future Work
Extended Analysis: Investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian economy and stock market beyond the initial recovery phase.

Comparative Studies: Compare the impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian stock market with other major global markets to contextualize findings.

Policy Impact Assessment: Analyze the effectiveness of government interventions and monetary policies in stabilizing the market during the pandemic.
